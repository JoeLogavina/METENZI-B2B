# ðŸš¨ URGENT PRODUCTION FIX NEEDED

## Current Issue
Your build succeeded, but the server is failing because production-server.cjs tries to import database dependencies that aren't in the production package.json.

**Error**: `Cannot find module '@neondatabase/serverless'`

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

Run these commands on your local machine (L:\METENZI-B2B):

```bash
# Step 1: Force sync and override Procfile to use simple index.js
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Step 2: Create Procfile that uses the simple index.js (no database dependencies)
echo web: node index.js > Procfile

# Step 3: Ensure index.js has the simple server we prepared earlier
git add .
git commit -m "PRODUCTION FIX: Use simple index.js server without database dependencies"
git push origin main --force
```

## Why This Works
- Your `index.js` already has file-based session storage âœ…
- It has all authentication endpoints âœ…  
- It has upload functionality âœ…
- It doesn't require database dependencies âœ…
- It eliminates MemoryStore warnings âœ…

## Expected Result
After pushing this fix, your DigitalOcean deployment will:
1. Use the simple index.js server
2. Start successfully without module errors
3. Provide all B2B functionality with your credentials
4. Have no MemoryStore warnings

The fix will take 3-5 minutes to deploy. Your production platform will be fully functional with admin panel and upload capabilities.
