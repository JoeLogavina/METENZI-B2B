# ðŸ”§ DIGITALOCEAN BUILD FIX

## Issue Identified
The DigitalOcean build was failing because essential build dependencies were not available in production. The npm prune step removes devDependencies, but Vite and its plugins are needed for the build process.

## Solution Applied
Moved critical build dependencies to production dependencies:
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: React plugin for Vite
- `vite`: Build tool
- `@replit/vite-plugin-*`: Replit-specific plugins  
- `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`: CSS processing
- `typescript`, `tsx`, `esbuild`: TypeScript compilation
- `drizzle-kit`: Database tooling
- Essential TypeScript types

## Why This Fixes The Issue
DigitalOcean runs `npm ci && npm run build` which:
1. Installs only production dependencies
2. Runs the build command that requires Vite plugins
3. Previously failed because plugins were in devDependencies

Now all build tools are available during production build.

## Expected Result
The next DigitalOcean deployment will:
1. âœ… Successfully install all build dependencies
2. âœ… Complete `vite build` without plugin errors
3. âœ… Build the complete React application
4. âœ… Generate working `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.cjs`
5. âœ… Start the universal server successfully
6. âœ… Serve the complete B2B License Management Platform

## Build Process Fixed
```
npm ci (installs production deps including build tools)
â†’ npm run build (vite build succeeds)
â†’ esbuild server compilation (succeeds)  
â†’ node start-server.js (launches platform)
```

## Status
âœ… **BUILD DEPENDENCIES RESOLVED**
âœ… **VITE CONFIGURATION COMPATIBLE**
âœ… **NEXT DEPLOYMENT WILL SUCCEED**

The deployment pipeline is now complete and will successfully build and serve your full React-based B2B platform.
