# Git Deployment Steps - Merge Conflict Resolution

## Current Status
Your Git shows merge conflicts that need to be resolved before deployment.

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Fetch and Pull Remote Changes
```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# Pull and merge remote changes (this may show merge conflicts)
git pull origin main
```

### 2. If Merge Conflicts Appear
```bash
# Check which files have conflicts
git status

# For each conflicted file, edit manually to resolve conflicts
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>
# Choose which version to keep or merge them manually

# After resolving conflicts in each file:
git add <conflicted-file>

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### 3. Alternative: Force Push (Use with Caution)
If you want to overwrite remote with your local changes:
```bash
# WARNING: This overwrites remote history
git push origin main --force
```

### 4. After Resolving Conflicts, Deploy
```bash
# Verify your files are correct
git status

# Push to trigger DigitalOcean deployment
git push origin main
```

## Quick Resolution Commands
```bash
# Option A: Pull and resolve conflicts
git pull origin main
# (resolve any conflicts manually)
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts and deploy production fix"
git push origin main

# Option B: Force push (overwrites remote)
git push origin main --force
```
