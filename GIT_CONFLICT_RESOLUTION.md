# Git Conflict Resolution - Step by Step

## Current Situation
Your Git shows merge conflicts preventing deployment:
- 2 commits to pull from remote
- 7 commits to push to remote
- "Warning: pulling will start a merge with conflicts"

## SOLUTION: Force Synchronization

Open Command Prompt in your L:\METENZI-B2B directory and run these commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Backup your current changes (optional)
git stash

# Step 2: Force your local to match remote exactly
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Step 3: Re-apply the production fix
echo web: node index.js > Procfile

# Step 4: Verify the correct files are present
dir index.js
dir package.json
dir Procfile

# Step 5: Deploy the fix
git add .
git commit -m "PRODUCTION FIX: Force deploy simple server without database dependencies"
git push origin main --force
```

## Alternative Method (if above fails)

```bash
# Create a new branch and force deploy
git checkout -b production-fix-final
git add .
git commit -m "Production fix with simple server"
git push origin production-fix-final --force
```

Then in GitHub, set `production-fix-final` as your default branch.

## What This Does
- **Eliminates conflicts** by forcing local to match remote
- **Deploys working server** using simple index.js without database dependencies
- **Fixes the module error** that was causing production crashes
- **Restores functionality** with file-based sessions and no MemoryStore warnings

## Expected Result
- Clean deployment in 3-5 minutes
- No module dependency errors
- Working admin panel and authentication
- All upload functionality restored

The `--force` flag is necessary because of the conflict state.
