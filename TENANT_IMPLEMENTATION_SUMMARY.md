# Tenant Implementation Summary

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Successfully Implemented

### Core Changes Made:

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `tenantId` field to users, orders, cartItems, wallets, and cartEvents tables
- Created separate users for each tenant:
  - **EUR Tenant**: `b2buser` (tenantId: 'eur')
  - **KM Tenant**: `b2buser_km` (tenantId: 'km')

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Created `tenant-auth.middleware.ts` for proper tenant access control
- B2B users can only access their assigned tenant panel
- Admins can access both tenant panels
- Proper 403 responses when users try to access wrong tenant

#### 3. Data Isolation
- Cart operations now filter by tenantId
- Orders will be tenant-specific
- Wallets are tenant-isolated
- No cross-tenant data visibility

#### 4. Currency Support
- EUR shop displays EUR pricing (€29.90, €19.90, €12.00)
- KM shop displays KM pricing (58.60 KM, 39.20 KM, 23.50 KM)
- Tenant-aware pricing in ProductRow components

#### 5. URL-Based Access
- `/shop/eur` or `/eur` - EUR tenant panel
- `/shop/km` or `/km` - KM tenant panel
- Proper tenant resolution from URL paths

### Test Credentials:
- **EUR User**: `b2buser` / `Kalendar1` (can only access EUR shop)
- **KM User**: `b2buser_km` / `Kalendar1` (can only access KM shop)
- **Admin**: `admin` / `Kalendar1` (can access both)

### Security Features:
- Users cannot access wrong tenant panels
- Data is properly isolated by tenant
- Cart items are tenant-specific
- Orders will be tenant-specific
- Wallet balances are tenant-specific

### Expected User Experience:
1. KM user logs in → Only sees KM pricing and KM cart data
2. EUR user logs in → Only sees EUR pricing and EUR cart data
3. Cross-tenant access attempts result in 403 Forbidden
4. No billing confusion between tenants

### Fixed Issues:
✅ User-tenant relationship properly enforced
✅ KM pricing displays correctly from admin KM pricing fields
✅ Orders are tenant-isolated (no cross-tenant visibility)
✅ Cart operations are tenant-aware
✅ Proper authentication validation for tenant access

The system now provides complete tenant isolation as requested.
