# ðŸš¨ URGENT: DigitalOcean Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
DigitalOcean is still serving the old static HTML page instead of the complete React-based B2B platform.

## Root Cause
The conflicting `index.js` file was causing DigitalOcean to run the wrong server, despite the correct `app.yaml` configuration.

## Solution Applied
1. âœ… Removed conflicting `index.js` file 
2. âœ… Ensured proper `app.yaml` configuration:
   ```yaml
   build_command: npm ci && npm run build
   run_command: npm start
   ```
3. âœ… Verified proper server exists at `dist/index.js` (599KB complete application)

## Expected Result
After DigitalOcean rebuilds and redeploys:
- `/eur` will serve the complete React-based B2B shop interface
- All authentication, user management, and enterprise features will be functional
- Professional Corporate Gray (#6E6F71) and Spanish Yellow (#FFB20F) branding
- Complete admin panel with integrated monitoring

## Critical Files
- `server/index.ts` - Main application server source
- `dist/index.js` - Built production server (599KB)
- `app.yaml` - DigitalOcean deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Build scripts configuration

## Next Steps
1. DigitalOcean will automatically rebuild with new configuration
2. Complete React-based B2B platform will be accessible
3. All enterprise features will be operational

**Status**: âœ… Configuration Fixed - Awaiting DigitalOcean Rebuild
