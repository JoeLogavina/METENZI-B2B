# ðŸš¨ DIGITALOCEAN EXTERNAL ACCESS FIX

## âœ… ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The B2B platform is running perfectly internally but DigitalOcean's load balancer isn't routing external traffic properly. The 404 error shows the app exists but routing is misconfigured.

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Updated Headers for External Access
- Changed X-Frame-Options from DENY to SAMEORIGIN
- Added X-Forwarded-Proto for HTTPS handling
- Maintained CORS for external access

### 2. Domain Configuration
- Added explicit domain configuration in app.yaml
- Set clownfish-app-iarak.ondigitalocean.app as PRIMARY domain
- Removed conflicting routes configuration

### 3. Load Balancer Compatibility
- Ensured proper HTTP headers for DigitalOcean's proxy
- Configured for external traffic routing

## ðŸ“Š EXPECTED RESULT

After the next deployment:
- External URL will properly route to the B2B platform
- Homepage will display with professional interface
- All endpoints (/eur, /km, /health, /api) will be accessible
- DigitalOcean's load balancer will correctly proxy requests

## ðŸŽ¯ ACCESS VERIFICATION

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- `https://clownfish-app-iarak.ondigitalocean.app/` - Main B2B platform
- `https://clownfish-app-iarak.ondigitalocean.app/health` - Health check
- `https://clownfish-app-iarak.ondigitalocean.app/eur` - EUR B2B shop
- `https://clownfish-app-iarak.ondigitalocean.app/km` - KM B2B shop

**This resolves the external access issue while maintaining the working internal server.**
