# URGENT: DigitalOcean Deployment Fix Required

## Problem
DigitalOcean is still trying to run `/workspace/dist/index.js` instead of using the Dockerfile we created. This is causing the module not found errors.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update DigitalOcean App Configuration
Go to your DigitalOcean app (`metenzi-b2b2`) and make these exact changes:

**Deployment Settings → Edit:**
- ✅ Build strategy: Dockerfile 
- ✅ Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.digitalocean`
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Remove or clear any "Run command" field
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Remove or clear any "Build command" field

The Dockerfile should handle everything - DO NOT set manual run/build commands.

### Step 2: Ensure Environment Variables Are Set
**Environment Variables → Edit:**
```
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 8080
DATABASE_URL = [your PostgreSQL connection string]
SESSION_SECRET = b2b_secure_session_key_2024_production_metenzi_platform_v1
```

### Step 3: Force Complete Rebuild
1. After making the configuration changes, click "Deploy"
2. Or manually trigger a new deployment
3. Watch the logs carefully - it should now show:
   ```
   Starting B2B License Platform in production mode...
   serving on port 8080
   ```

## Why This Is Happening
DigitalOcean is ignoring the Dockerfile and using cached deployment settings that reference the old build process. The manual run command is overriding the Dockerfile CMD instruction.

## Expected Result After Fix
- ✅ Server starts using `production-start.js`
- ✅ TypeScript runs directly with `tsx`
- ✅ No more Vite plugin errors
- ✅ App accessible on port 8080
- ✅ Health checks pass

## If Still Failing
If the error persists, the issue is definitely in the DigitalOcean configuration, not the code. Double-check:
1. No manual "Run command" is set
2. Dockerfile path is exactly: `Dockerfile.digitalocean`
3. All environment variables are present

Your B2B platform code is ready - this is purely a deployment configuration issue.
