# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack B2B software license management platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides enterprise customers with a streamlined interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, while offering administrators comprehensive tools for inventory and user management. The system now uses custom username/password authentication and displays all prices in EUR currency.

## System Architecture

### Current Architecture (Functional)
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter routing, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, RESTful API design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom username/password with Passport.js
- **Structure**: Monolithic route structure with basic role-based access

### Enterprise Architecture Recommendations
Based on analysis of current admin/B2B portal connections, several enterprise-level improvements are recommended:

#### 1. Layered Architecture
- **Current Issue**: All logic mixed in route handlers
- **Solution**: Separate Controller → Service → Repository layers
- **Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns, better testability

#### 2. Advanced Security
- **Current Issue**: Inline role checking, no audit trails
- **Solution**: Permission-based middleware, comprehensive audit logging
- **Benefit**: Granular permissions, compliance-ready audit trails

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Current Issue**: Every request hits database, no caching
- **Solution**: Multi-layer caching, query optimization, rate limiting
- **Benefit**: 40-60% response time improvement, reduced database load

#### 4. Error Handling
- **Current Issue**: Basic try-catch with generic errors
- **Solution**: Typed error hierarchy, centralized error handling
- **Benefit**: Better debugging, proper HTTP status codes, structured responses

#### 5. Validation Pipeline
- **Current Issue**: Inline validation scattered in routes
- **Solution**: Middleware-based validation pipeline
- **Benefit**: Consistent validation, better error messages, reduced code duplication
