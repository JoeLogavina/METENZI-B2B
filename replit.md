# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack B2B software license management platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides enterprise customers with a streamlined interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, while offering administrators comprehensive tools for inventory and user management. The system now uses custom username/password authentication and displays all prices in EUR currency.

- **State Synchronization**: Optimistic updates with server-side validation

### Database Operations
- **CRUD Operations**: Type-safe database operations through Drizzle ORM
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless connection pooling for scalability
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL serverless driver
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

### Authentication & Security
- **openid-client**: OpenID Connect client implementation
- **passport**: Authentication middleware
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Client Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation check before build

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite dev server
- **Production**: Static file serving with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Sessions**: Secure session configuration with SESSION_SECRET

### Replit Integration
- **Development Banner**: Replit development environment indicator
- **Cartographer**: Replit-specific development tools integration
- **Runtime Error Overlay**: Development error reporting

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript definitions, enabling type safety across the full stack while maintaining clear separation between client and server concerns.
