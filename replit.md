# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview
This project is a full-stack B2B software license management platform. Its purpose is to provide enterprise customers with an interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, while offering administrators tools for inventory and user management. Key capabilities include a 3-level hierarchical category system, comprehensive B2B client management with custom pricing, and robust order processing with sequential numbering and shared license key pools. The platform aims to be a streamlined, high-performance, and secure solution for B2B software distribution, using custom username/password authentication and displaying all prices in EUR.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a responsive design with a sidebar navigation. The color scheme uses Corporate Gray (#6E6F71) and Spanish Yellow (#FFB20F) for accents, prices, buttons, and active states. Sidebar text and icon sizes are increased for visibility, and text color is white for improved contrast. Tables use Corporate Gray backgrounds for headers.

### Technical Implementations
The system is built with a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository) for improved testability and maintainability. It incorporates advanced security features, comprehensive error handling with typed error hierarchies, and a middleware-based validation pipeline.

### Production API Implementation (August 2025)
Complete production CommonJS server implemented with full API functionality for DigitalOcean deployment. Features include authentication with Passport.js, complete B2B business logic (products, orders, cart, wallet), admin dashboard, role-based access control, PostgreSQL database integration with smart fallback system, session management, and comprehensive error handling. All 20+ API endpoints implemented and tested.
