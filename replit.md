# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack B2B software license management platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides enterprise customers with a streamlined interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, while offering administrators comprehensive tools for inventory and user management. The system now uses custom username/password authentication and displays all prices in EUR currency.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
- **CRITICAL RLS SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED** (January 28, 2025):
  - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies were completely non-functional due to Neon serverless connection pooling clearing session variables between requests
