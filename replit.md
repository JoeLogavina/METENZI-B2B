# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview
This is a full-stack B2B software license management platform. It provides enterprise customers with an interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, and offers administrators tools for inventory and user management. The system uses custom username/password authentication and displays all prices in EUR currency. Key capabilities include a 3-level hierarchical category system, comprehensive B2B client management with custom pricing, and robust order processing with sequential numbering and shared license key pools. The project aims to provide a streamlined, high-performance, and secure solution for B2B software distribution.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a responsive design with a sidebar navigation. The color scheme uses Corporate Gray (#6E6F71) and Spanish Yellow (#FFB20F) for accents, prices, buttons, and active states. Sidebar text and icon sizes are increased for visibility, and text color is white for improved contrast. Tables use Corporate Gray backgrounds for headers.

### Technical Implementations
The system is built with a layered architecture, separating concerns into Controller, Service, and Repository layers for improved testability and maintainability. It incorporates advanced security features, comprehensive error handling with typed error hierarchies, and a middleware-based validation pipeline for consistent data validation.
