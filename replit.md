# B2B Software License Management Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack B2B software license management platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides enterprise customers with a streamlined interface to browse, purchase, and manage software licenses, while offering administrators comprehensive tools for inventory and user management. The system now uses custom username/password authentication and displays all prices in EUR currency.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

  - Created service layer with ProductService and UserService for business logic separation
  - Added enterprise middleware system with permission-based authorization
  - Implemented typed error handling with proper HTTP status codes
  - Added comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security
  - Created controller layer for clean HTTP request/response handling
  - Integrated rate limiting (300 requests per 15 minutes) and input validation pipeline
- Migrated from Replit Auth to custom username/password authentication system
- Implemented EUR currency display throughout the application (€790, €1,890, €250, etc.)
- Created admin and B2B user test accounts (admin/Kalendar1, b2buser/Kalendar1)
- Fixed authentication infinite loop and 401 request issues
- Updated all user ID references to work with new authentication system
- Updated color scheme from Coffee Mist to Corporate Gray (#6E6F71) and Spanish Yellow (#FFB20F)
- Applied new color palette throughout admin portal and B2B shop interfaces
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with Spanish Yellow accents for prices, buttons, and active states
- Increased sidebar text and icon sizes by 35% for better visibility
- Changed sidebar text from gray to white for improved contrast
- Updated table headers with new Corporate Gray background color

## System Architecture

### Current Architecture (Functional)
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter routing, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, RESTful API design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom username/password with Passport.js
- **Structure**: Monolithic route structure with basic role-based access

### Enterprise Architecture Recommendations
Based on analysis of current admin/B2B portal connections, several enterprise-level improvements are recommended:

#### 1. Layered Architecture
- **Current Issue**: All logic mixed in route handlers
- **Solution**: Separate Controller → Service → Repository layers
- **Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns, better testability

#### 2. Advanced Security
- **Current Issue**: Inline role checking, no audit trails
- **Solution**: Permission-based middleware, comprehensive audit logging
- **Benefit**: Granular permissions, compliance-ready audit trails

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Current Issue**: Every request hits database, no caching
- **Solution**: Multi-layer caching, query optimization, rate limiting
- **Benefit**: 40-60% response time improvement, reduced database load

#### 4. Error Handling
- **Current Issue**: Basic try-catch with generic errors
- **Solution**: Typed error hierarchy, centralized error handling
- **Benefit**: Better debugging, proper HTTP status codes, structured responses

#### 5. Validation Pipeline
- **Current Issue**: Inline validation scattered in routes
- **Solution**: Middleware-based validation pipeline
- **Benefit**: Consistent validation, better error messages, reduced code duplication

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Created enterprise middleware system (auth.middleware.ts)
- ✅ Added service layer pattern (product.service.ts)
- ✅ Implemented error handling (errors.ts)
- ✅ Created controller separation (admin/products.controller.ts)
- ✅ Added route organization (admin/products.routes.ts)

See `ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md` for detailed analysis and implementation guides.

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Shared schema definitions between client and server
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Custom username/password authentication with Passport.js
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (b2b_user, admin, super_admin)
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags for production
- **Accounts**: admin/Kalendar1 (super_admin), b2buser/Kalendar1 (b2b_user)

### User Interface Components
- **Layout**: Responsive sidebar navigation with role-based menu items
- **Product Catalog**: Filterable product table with search and category filters
- **Shopping Cart**: Modal-based cart with quantity management
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive dashboard for administrators

### Data Models
- **Users**: Profile information with role-based permissions
- **Products**: Software licenses with pricing, regions, and platform support
- **Categories**: Product categorization system
- **Orders**: Purchase tracking and order history
- **License Keys**: Digital license key management
- **Cart Items**: Session-based shopping cart functionality

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
- **API Requests**: RESTful endpoints with JSON payloads
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with automatic redirect handling
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **State Synchronization**: Optimistic updates with server-side validation

### Database Operations
- **CRUD Operations**: Type-safe database operations through Drizzle ORM
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless connection pooling for scalability
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL serverless driver
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
