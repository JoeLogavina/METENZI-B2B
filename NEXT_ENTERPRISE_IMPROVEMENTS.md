    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),

        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run test
          npm run build
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |

## üöÄ **Priority 4: Advanced Security (Current: 8.5/10 ‚Üí Target: 9.5/10)**

### **What This Includes:**

#### **1. Security Headers & CORS**
```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';

app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,

## üîç **Recommended Next Step**

**Start with Monitoring & Observability** because:
1. **Foundation for Everything**: You can't optimize what you can't measure
2. **Immediate Value**: See real performance data and catch issues early
3. **Low Risk**: Non-breaking changes to existing functionality
4. **High Impact**: Essential for production confidence
