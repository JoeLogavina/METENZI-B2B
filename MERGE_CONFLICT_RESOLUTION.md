# Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

## Current Situation
Git is showing merge conflicts in 3 files:
- Procfile (conflicting)
- package-lock.json (conflicting) 
- package.json (conflicting)
- index.js (other changed file)

## How to Resolve in VS Code Interface

### Step 1: For Each Conflicting File

**Procfile**: Choose "Accept Incoming Change" 
- This will use: `web: node index.js`

**package.json**: Choose "Accept Incoming Change"
- This will use the production package.json with build script

**package-lock.json**: Choose "Accept Incoming Change"
- This will use the correct lock file

### Step 2: Complete the Merge
1. After resolving all conflicts, click "Complete merge and commit"
2. This will create a merge commit combining all changes

### Step 3: Verify and Push
The merge will automatically sync your local with remote, eliminating the conflict.

## Alternative: Command Line Resolution

If you prefer command line:
```bash
# Accept all incoming changes (from remote)
git checkout --theirs Procfile package.json package-lock.json

# Complete the merge
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts - accept production configuration"
git push origin main
```

## What This Accomplishes
- Eliminates the Git sync conflicts
- Ensures your local matches the successful production deployment
- Maintains the working Procfile and package.json for production

Your DigitalOcean deployment should already be live regardless of this merge resolution.
