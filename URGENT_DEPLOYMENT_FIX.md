# ðŸš¨ URGENT DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Real Problem

The issue is that DigitalOcean's npm install with `--no-save` isn't properly making the packages available to the subsequent build commands. The packages are installed but not in the correct scope.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Change Build Command

Replace your current DigitalOcean Build Command with this more robust version:

```bash
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react@latest vite@latest esbuild@latest typescript@latest && npm run build && echo '{"type":"module"}' > dist/package.json
```

**Remove the `--no-save` flag** - this was causing the packages to not be properly available.

## Alternative Solution - Use Global Install

If the above doesn't work, try this approach:

```bash
npm install -g @vitejs/plugin-react vite esbuild typescript && npm run build && echo '{"type":"module"}' > dist/package.json
```

## Why This Will Work

1. **Removes `--no-save`** - packages will be properly installed and available
2. **Uses latest versions** - ensures compatibility  
3. **Installs before build** - packages are available when vite.config.ts is loaded
4. **Creates ES module config** - proper module type for production

## Test This First

Try the first solution (without `--no-save`) as it's the safest approach. The temporary installation will still work but the packages will be properly available during the build process.

## DigitalOcean Settings

- **Build Command**: `npm install @vitejs/plugin-react@latest vite@latest esbuild@latest typescript@latest && npm run build && echo '{"type":"module"}' > dist/package.json`
- **Run Command**: `node dist/index.js`

This should resolve the "Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react'" error completely.
