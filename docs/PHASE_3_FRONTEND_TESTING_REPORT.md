## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState<'shop' | 'support'>('shop');

// Sidebar item configuration
{
  icon: HelpCircle,
  label: "SUPPORT",
  active: activeView === 'support',
  action: () => setActiveView('support'),
  allowed: true
}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```tsx
{activeView === 'support' ? (
  <div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
    <FrontendSupportManagement />
  </div>
) : (
  // Original shop content
)}
```
