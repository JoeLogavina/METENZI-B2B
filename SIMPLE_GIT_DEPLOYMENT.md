# Simple Git Deployment Solution

## The Issue
Your DigitalOcean deployment failed because package-lock.json is out of sync with package.json.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Remove the problematic package-lock.json
```bash
git rm package-lock.json
git commit -m "Remove package-lock.json to fix deployment sync"
```

### Step 2: Copy your production files and deploy
```bash
# Copy the production server and package files
cp production-deployment/index.js ./index.js  
cp production-deployment/package.json ./package.json

# Commit and push to trigger deployment
git add index.js package.json
git commit -m "Deploy production session fix - eliminates MemoryStore warnings"
git push origin main
```

## What Happens
1. DigitalOcean pulls your updated files
2. Sees no package-lock.json, so it generates a fresh one
3. Installs all dependencies correctly
4. Deploys your fixed server with file-based sessions

## Environment Variable (Set in DigitalOcean)
Don't forget to add this in your DigitalOcean App Settings → Environment Variables:
```
SESSION_SECRET=042ed3bdf9db9119f62b9b2b9f8610c99310dca1227cf355538edcc7c156a7c6
```

## Expected Result
After deployment (3-5 minutes):
- ✅ No more MemoryStore warnings
- ✅ Admin panel upload functionality restored  
- ✅ All authentication working (admin/password123, b2bkm/password123, munich_branch/password123)
- ✅ Clean deployment logs with no errors

## Files Ready
Your production-deployment folder contains:
- `index.js` - Production server with file-based sessions
- `package.json` - Correct dependencies (express-session, session-file-store, passport, bcrypt, multer)

That's it! Just remove package-lock.json and push the production files.
