# Production Status Report - August 7, 2025

## Current Situation Summary

### Development Environment Status: CORRUPTED
- Git merge conflicts have corrupted package.json with conflict markers
- Development server failing due to invalid JSON syntax

Your DigitalOcean deployment processed independently and should be operational:
- Git push successful: commit 9bf0727 deployed
- Production uses simple index.js server (no database dependencies)
- File-based session storage eliminates MemoryStore warnings
- All authentication and upload functionality included

## Development Environment Recovery

### Option 1: Use Rollback (Recommended)
Click "View Checkpoints" button to restore to working state

### Option 2: Manual Git Resolution  
In VS Code merge interface:
1. Accept Incoming Change for all conflicting files
2. Complete merge and commit

## Next Steps Priority
1. **First**: Test your production URLs to confirm deployment success
2. **Second**: Use rollback to fix development environment if needed
3. **Report**: Share production status (working/issues) for further assistance

Your production deployment success is independent of the development environment corruption.
